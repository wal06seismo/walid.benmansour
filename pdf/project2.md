## Plume interaction and spreading ridge: Galapagos archipelagos

**Project description:** Hot spot volcanism is widely thought to be the result of upwelling and melting of hot, buoyant mantle [Morgan, 1971]. About 21 of the proposed 30 to 50 hot spots on Earth are, however, located near mid-ocean ridges and interact with young, thin lithosphere, resulting in geomorphological and geochemical anomalies along the spreading axes (e.g. Christie et al., 2005, Detrick et al., 2002, Ito et al., 2003, Sinton et al., 2003). While plume material can influence nearby ridges for distances of up to 1000 km along-axis (Schilling et al., 1976, Schilling et al., 1982, Vogt, 1976), the extent to which plume material that a) does not how into the ridge system spreads laterally along the base of the lithosphere away from the ridge axis and b) affects the chemical composition of the upper mantle (asthenosphere and possibly lithosphere) is still poorly constrained.

The Gal치pagos archipelago, located west of Ecuador, is a good example where a mantle plume interacts with a spreading center and modifies physical and chemical properties of the oceanic lithosphere. The Gal치pagos Spreading Center (GSC) and the Gal치pagos hotspot interact over more than 1,000 km with unusual features for a hot spot region (large number of historical active volcanoes, large range of lavas composition, alignment of volcanic centers and seamounts). To bring new information on the physical and chemical properties of this region, we are constructing a new P-wave velocity model of this region by combining data from 10 seismic broadband stations and from 9 MERMAIDS (Mobile Earthquake Recorder in Marine Areas by Independent Divers) deployed in this region between 2014 and 2016.

## Thermochemical imaging

**Methodology:**
We apply a multi-observable probabilistic inversion method. This is a joint inversion approach specifically designed to retrieve the physical state (e.g. temperature distribution, compositional structure,stress/strain distributions, etc.) of the lithosphere and sublithospheric upper mantle by inverting key data sets with complementary sensitivities to the main fields of interest. The inverse problem is cast into a statistical (Bayesian) inference problem considering all major sources of uncertainty. The solution to the inverse problem is a multi-dimensional probability distribution over the parameters of interest, known as the posterior distribution. Since this distribution has no analytical solution, we estimate it by constructing a Markov chain that has the posterior has its equilibrium distribution. In contrast to more traditional inversion methods, we invert directly for are the main thermodynamic variables temperature, pressure and composition. The link between these primary parameters and the physical parameters needed to solve the forward problems (e.g. bulk density, bulk modulus) isprovided by a full thermodynamic model and an internally-consistent thermodynamic database. Such a consistency is key to guaranteeing that our models will not violate fundamental thermodynamic relations.
