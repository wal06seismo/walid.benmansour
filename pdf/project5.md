## Patagonian Slab window


**Project description:** It is well known that the physical state of the mantle (temperature, bulk composition, viscosity) controls the present-day surface topography and the stress distribution within the lithosphere. Locally, the slab geometry along a subduction zone also affects the mantle flow pattern and the mantle's properties. When a spreading ridge intersects a subduction zone, a slab window can be generated, and the mantleâ€™s properties will be then modified. Patagonia is the perfect example of a spreading ridge intersecting 16 Myr ago a subduction zone and opening a window in the slab. The triple junction zone (Nazca, Antarctica, South America) splits a region with a strong seismic and volcanic hazard (northern part) to the southern region relatively quieter. Early studies with a poorly seismic network coverage support the idea of this slab window and its effect on the mantle flow pattern beneath South America. Recently, twenty-six broadband seismic stations were deployed in Southern Patagonia to fill the data gap between latitude 45oS and 55oS.
